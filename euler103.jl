Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a special sum set if for any
two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:

S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special sum set.
The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.

n = 1: {1}
n = 2: {1,  2}
n = 3: {2,  3,  4}
n = 4: {3,  5,  6,  7}
n = 5: {6,  9,  11, 12, 13}
n = 6: {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}
--------------------------------------
nP= 7: {20, 31, 38, 39, 40, 42, 45}  Predicted
--------------------------------------
n = 7: {20, 31, 38, 39, 40, 42,45}   Actual

It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a1, a2, ... , an},
the next optimum set is of the form B = {b, a1+b, a2+b, ... ,an+b},
where b is the "middle" element on the previous row.

By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be
A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117.
However, this is not the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set.
The optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and corresponding set string: 111819202225.
Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string.

## Now lets take the hint that the algorithm is close to optimal. Lets take the prediction and then perturb it a bit.
## Clearly a heuristic approach.
## Lets look at what n7 is predicted to be by the the Non-optimal algorithm.

## Let's add a little noise to come up with a longer list. Essentially add/sub a 1 from each number.
