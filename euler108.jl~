In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1
x
+
1
y
=
    1
    n
    For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

1
5
+
1
20
=
    1
    4
    1
    6
    +
    1
    12
    =
        1
        4
        1
        8
        +
        1
        8
        =
            1
            4
            What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?

                NOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.
